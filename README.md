20.05.2021 – root – hierarchymanager

This software helps creating hierarchies out of a big amount of elements. It visualizes the such build hierarchy and its elements relations.
By reducing the complexity of building a hierarchy to a set of Yes/No-questions,
it allows complete automation of the process by a function that gives the parent-child relation of any two elements.
